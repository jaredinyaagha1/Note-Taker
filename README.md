# Note Taker

# Description
### This application is a small tool I deployed onto Heroku to allow me to create, save, and edit various notes all in one place! I used express.js to establish the routes. The functions in the routes are written inside the controllers.js and used within the apiRoutes.js and htmlRoutes.js
